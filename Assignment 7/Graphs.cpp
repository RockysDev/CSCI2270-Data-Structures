Graphs

Graph is //trivial if it only has one vertex
The edges are connected between the vertices but are specified as pairs

Directed  = arrows
Undirect != Arrows

Weighted Graph
    - The Arrows can have "distances" between eachother. similar to dijkstras.

Adjacency Matrix
    -Ket G be a graph with N vertices n>0
    - Let V(g) = (v1,v2,...vn)
    = Ag(i,j) = {1 if (vi,vj) subset E(g), 0 otherwise} 
        - This is seeing if there's an arrow between node or not
        
Depth First Search is better if target is further from source.
