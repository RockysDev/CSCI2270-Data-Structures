Password Verification on websites

256 bit = 64 char string

Collisions

Types of collisions
    Hash code collisions
    Bucket collision

2 ways to solve.
    Open addressing.\
    Linear probing
        -See if something is in right bucket, if not go next
        circular array go to start q is not in bucket 6.
    Quadratic probing
